            <h2>Exploring the causes, impacts and solutions of air pollution </h2>
            <p>
                As a part of my services in action project, I went to explore the causes of air pollution in our city, who plays a key role in it, what are their motivations and how we can help to reduce it.
<br>
<br>
I interviewed the local farmers to understand if they burn crops, and if they did then what were the main reasons why they did it. Not just that, I also interviewed people who work in petrol station to measure vehicle emissions to understand their technique and get an idea of what parameters they use to measure pollution.
