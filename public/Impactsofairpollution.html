            <h1>Impacts of Air Pollution</h1>
            <p>There are serious impacts of air pollution on our body and environment around us. These issues raise from health impacts such as lung cancer, respiratory issues, heart diseases, etc. In addition air pollution causes acid rains that impact buildings and soil. Even animal species aren't spared from the environmental impacts of air pollution. </p>

        <h2>Health impacts of air pollution</h2>
        <p>One of the impacts of pollution is that it can lead to severe diseases such as lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory. The main reason why pollution can cause all of these problems is because pollution is formed from many harmful gasses. When these gasses including sulfur and carbon dioxide  are inhaled by people everyday it can cause some problems. At first someone might experience trouble breathing and then later on develop one of these diseases. These serious diseases can also cause death to some people as it might worsen their conditions if their problems persist. </p>

        <h2>Acid Rain</h2>
            <p>Another one of the impacts of pollution could be acid rain. One of the reasons why acid rain forms is because all of the harmful air gasses such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide mix in with the normal pure water in the clouds. Then all of the normal rain would fall down as acid rain and because of this acid rain it can damage many monuments. One of the main reasons why monuments like the Taj Mahal have become more dull is because acid rain is impacting them a lot and damaging them very severely over time. This would be very bad as it destroys the unique shape of the monument in a very negative manner.</p>

        <h2>Environmental Impacts</h2>
        <p>Air pollution can also impact the environment in a negative way. As I mentioned before, acid rain is the impact of air pollution, when it comes down it can cause deforestation. During acid rain, many animals will lose their homes and they would also lose their lives and be forced to adapt to other non suitable ecosystems for them. Over 1 million animals die every year because of air pollution. The reason why many animals would die would be because of the harmful gases such as Nitrogen oxide and Sulfur dioxide present in the air. Since many animals won’t be able to breathe these gases, they would start dying out. </p>
