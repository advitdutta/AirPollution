    <h1>Causes of Air Pollution</h1>
        <p>There are various causes of air pollution. These causes include farmers burning their leftover crops, vehicle emissions, construction activities, fireworks, etc. One of the primary causes of air pollution in Gurgaon is vehicle emissions. Vehicle emissions make up about 38% of the pollution here in Delhi NCR. There are a few inorganic aerosols released by the vehicle emissions into the atmosphere. These aerosols include sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. Automotive vehicles also release some very harmful pollutants into the air. This depends on the quality of the fuel that these vehicles consume and their energy efficiency. </p>

    <h2>Crop Burning</h2>
        <p>Another one of the main causes of air pollution include farmers burning their crops. 

            As a part of my SAA I went to interview some farmers in the vicinity of Gurgaon. I gained the perspectives of two different types of farmers, rich and poor farmers. During my interview, I asked the farmers about the reasons they were burning crops. The poor farmer told me that the main reason why they burn crops was mainly because they didn’t have any machines to remove all of the leftover crops in their yields, as machines were very expensive to them . Some of the farmers I had interviewed didn’t tell me if they burned leftover crops or not as I believe they might be scared of government fines.
            
            The rich farmer on the other hand told me that he had gained more profit without spending his money on machinery and burning the crops. He in fact, used hands to remove all of the leftover crops as he was able to hire some additional people. His yields would become more clean and he wouldn’t have to worry about removing every last crop. So I compared the profit of both of the farmers and I came to a conclusion that the rich farmer had more profit as his yields were cleaner and he didn’t take part in the burning of crops which would lead to a lot more pollution.

    <h2>Fireworks</h2>
        <p>Air pollution can also be caused by firecrackers. On occasions like Diwali, the usage of firecrackers is the most popular as almost everyone uses them. It is estimated that one firecracker releases 17 tonnes of CO2 when burnt. This means that there would be millions of tonnes of CO2 produced by firecrackers each year in Delhi NCR. One of the ways that firecrackers contribute to the amount of air pollution is because they release many metal particles and many dangerous toxins which stay in the air for a long time and they disrupt the level of the AQI in Delhi.
